# Chapter 1 : An Introduction to Cryptography

## Simple substitution ciphers

In this section, we explore the most fundamental cipher that almost anyone (including non-cryptographers) knows about : <ins> ***Caesar Cipher*** </ins>, named in honor of ***Julius Caesar***

## Divisibility and greatest common divisors

## Modular arithmetics

## Prime numbers, unique factorization, and finite fields

## Powers and primitive roots in finite fields

## Cryptography before the computer age

## Symmetric and asymmetric ciphers
