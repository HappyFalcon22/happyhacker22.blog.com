# Hello

My name is ***Thang Trinh Cao***. I am a final-year student studying in Bach Khoa University of Technology - Ho Chi Minh City. I studied Computer Engineering Program as my main major, but I am interested in Cryptography and a less common corner of cryptograpghy - Zero-Knowledge Proofs.

I am a moderate CTF player in the school team `BKISC`, and we have come through a lot of challenging CTF events (Google CTF, Sekai CTF, ...). I am specialised in Cryptography and can do a little bit of Reverse Engineering.

I posted my dark secrets in this site, it's up to you to find out if you are interested :-)
